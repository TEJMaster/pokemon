## An analysis of Pokemon data

### Overview

We examine data about Pokémon to understand the relationships between their various attributes. We estimate a Bayesian hierarchical model that explains their attributes based on their functionality and other factors.

### File Structure

The repo is structured as:

- `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from the Pokemon wiki.
- `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
- `model` contains fitted models.
- `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
- `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
- `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

### Statement on LLM usage
The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in `inputs/llms/usage.txt`.
